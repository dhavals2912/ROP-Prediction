This project is to predict the "Rate of Penetration( ROP)" value.

The project contains three jupyter notebook files:
1. Code file: Contains how to train a superlearner model
2. ROP prediction file: Contains methodology to predict ROP values using trained superlearner.
3. Analysis and model selection: This notebook contains Rough analysis about dataset and accuracy of different ML models.
